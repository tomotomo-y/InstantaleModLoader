rem  Instantale mod loader -- distribution builder
rem
rem  Builds three release assets, so the loader and the mods can be attached to
rem  a GitHub release as separate downloads:
rem
rem    InstantaleModLoader-<ver>-full.zip   loader + every mod (for new players)
rem    InstantaleModLoader-<ver>.zip        loader only
rem    InstantaleMods-<ver>.zip             every mod, no loader
rem
rem  The mods package is shaped for the manager: "MOD wo tsuika..." reads a zip,
rem  finds every folder holding a mod.json whatever the depth, and copies it
rem  into runtime\mods\. So the whole pack installs in one step, and so does a
rem  single mod folder pulled out of it.
rem
rem  What goes where:
rem    loader   InstantaleModLoader.bat, LICENSE, NOTICE, tools\, docs\,
rem             runtime\instantale_modloader\, runtime\mods\_template\
rem    mods     runtime\mods\* except _template, plus LICENSE and NOTICE
rem    full     the two merged, plus load_order.json
rem
rem  _template ships with the loader, not with the mods: it is the starting
rem  point for writing a mod, and the loader skips folders starting with "_".
rem
rem  load_order.json ships in the full package only. Elsewhere it would name
rem  mods that are not installed, and the loader reports that as a problem.
rem  Leaving it out costs nothing: with no order file the loader sorts by folder
rem  name -- which the number prefixes already make correct -- and then applies
rem  the after/before rules from each mod.json.
rem
rem  LICENSE and NOTICE are in every package, including the mods-only one: MIT
rem  requires the copyright notice to travel with every copy, so a package
rem  without them is not a lawful redistribution. NOTICE states what the grant
rem  does and does not cover (game-derived strings, GAME.md, the EULA question).
rem
rem  Never shipped: out\, state\ and settings\ (all three made at
rem  runtime), __pycache__ / *.pyc, tools\tests\test_*.py and the one-off save fixers, and
rem  llm_replacements.txt / npc.json -- those last two are the player's own copy
rem  of a mod's data file, so only the shipped *.default.* versions go in.
rem
rem    make_dist.bat           version comes from runtime\instantale_modloader
rem    make_dist.bat 1.2.0     override the version string
rem
rem  Staging trees are kept under dist\_stage\ for checking. The zips land in
rem  dist\ directly, and they are the only things meant to be uploaded.
rem
rem  Python is optional here: if one is found the staged .py files are
rem  byte-compiled as a syntax check, then the caches are removed again.
rem
rem  ASCII only on purpose: a .bat is read using the current console code page,
rem  so non-ASCII text here would break parsing on some machines.

rem ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
rem  :zip <staging folder> <zip path>
rem  Packs the folder itself, so the zip carries that folder as its top entry.
rem
rem  The entries are written one by one instead of with Compress-Archive.
rem  Windows PowerShell 5.1 ships a Compress-Archive that emits a bare
rem  directory entry for any folder holding no files directly -- runtime\ is
rem  exactly that, holding only instantale_modloader\ and mods\ -- and it
rem  writes that entry with no attributes set. Extractors that read the
rem  attributes rather than the trailing slash then create a 0-byte *file*
rem  named runtime, and every runtime\... file after it has nowhere to go.
rem  Explorer copes, several other archivers do not.
rem
rem  ZipFile::CreateFromDirectory is not the fix: on .NET Framework, which is
rem  what 5.1 runs on, it separates entry names with "\" instead of "/", which
rem  breaks a different set of extractors.
rem
rem  So: open the archive and add each file under a forward-slash relative
rem  name. Empty folders are dropped, which costs nothing here -- the loader
rem  reads files, and out\, state\ and settings\ are made at runtime anyway.

rem
rem  Watches for the game to start and injects the mod loader automatically.
rem  Just leave this window open. Press Ctrl-C to stop.
rem
rem  The injection dies with the game process, so it has to be redone every time
rem  the game starts. Keeping this running removes that chore.
rem
rem  Arguments are passed straight through to watcher.py:
rem    watch.bat            keep watching
rem    watch.bat --once     inject into the running game once, then exit
rem
rem  Needs 64-bit Python (the game is x64). Prefers 3.13, then the py launcher,
rem  then whatever "python" is on PATH.
rem
rem  ASCII only on purpose: a .bat is read using the current console code page,
rem  so non-ASCII text here would break parsing on some machines.
rem  Japanese notes live in docs\README.md / docs\TECH.md.
rem  The GUI (..\InstantaleModLoader.bat) does the same job with a window.
